        <h1>Some writing tips</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Tell a story</b>
                <p><a href="https://www.innovativehumancapital.com/post/the-power-of-storytelling-how-our-brains-are-wired-for-narratives#:~:text=Science%20confirms%20what%20our%20intuition,very%20anatomy%20of%20our%20brains.">Humans are wired to tell stories.</a>
                    <br>
                    Try to tell a narrative story. That's how the admissions officers will remember you; not your name, your grade, or your classes, but your story.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use cultural language</b>
                <p>This effectively <a href="https://essaysthatworked.com/essays?id=149">highlights your cultural background</a> and can enhance your story. We'll use this
                    story as a case study.
                    Don't be afraid to show your background! A lot of people might balk at the idea in fear colleges might
                    reject based on their culture, especially Asian Americans. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use personal nicknames</b>
                <p>Nicknames help bring the reader into your perspective. 
                    Even something as simple as replacing "My father" with "Dad" can go a long way.
                    You can use cultural nicknames, e.g. "Grandpa" => "wai gong"
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>70-30 breakdown</b>
                <p>I recommend the following breakdown: 70% for setup/story telling, and 30% for reflection/monolouge.
                    The reflection doesn't necessecarily have to be about growth. Again, don't force it. 
                    Just talk about how this experience changed you. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make uses of metaphors</b>
                <p>
                    "I felt adrift in a sea of ambiguous identity". Stylistic choices like these are what makes essays memorable
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make use of parallel structure</b>
                <p>From the essay linked above: 
                    "I wanted to demolish that language barrier, to jump up and down on its remains, to destory what marked me as an imposter, a pretender, a fake</p>
                <p>Notice that this sentence isn't gramatically correct, but it doesn't matter, it still effectively conveys the author's feelings. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Know when to be descriptive</b>
                <p>"Pulicking gogosi", "Watching Buni spoon...". Include details that bring reader into the moment. You don't have to describe every little detail. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>There's no one size fits all</b>
                <p>

                    Everything here are recommendations, not rules.
                </p>

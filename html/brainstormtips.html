        <h1>Some writing tips</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Your essay should feel uncomfortable to talk about. </b>
                <p> Have you ever had the feeling where you tell someone a secret, and now you feel that you've gotten closer?
                    That's what you want the admisssions officer to feel.
                    <br><br>
                    Approach the personal statement in the same way. 
                    <br><br>
                    Think of it as a secret you'll only tell your best friend. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Read a lot personal statements. </b>
                <p>I recommend <a href="wwww.essaysthatworked.com">essays that worked</a>. Really go into the structure of the essay, 
                such as word choices, paragraph flow, cultural references. Deeply analyze what makes someone's essay good, and try to replicate that</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u>Write things down</u></b>
                <p>Getting an incomplete idea down in writing is better than having nothing at all.
                    Some ideas might sound good in your head but writing it down makes you realize it's shallow. 
                    Conversly, some ideas you might think don't lead anywhere and might lead to a big breakthrough.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Save all of your drafts</b>
                <p>Create a google folder for your college related stuff and put all of your drafts inside. 
                    What might not work for a personal statement might work for a supplemental essay
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Don't get bogged down</b>
                <p> If you don't like a draft because of content issues, don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. 
                    Try a new idea. Play around!

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Almost all good personal narratives talk about family</b>
                <p>Connections with other people are the single most powerful thing to talk about, especially relating to family. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Be careful with overused/cliche topics.</b>
                <p>There are more difficult to write; make sure you have a unique twist that's special to you.</p>
                <p>Some cliche topics: cooking, breakup, moving, sports success/defeat/challenges, volunteering</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><u><i>Spend time</i></u></b>
                <p>The most important one. Good essays take time to develop and plan</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
